Git add . : Add all files modified to staging area
Git commit : Commit files modified
Git log : Check submission history
Git Push: Push the modifies to github
Git merge: Combine 2 branches and create a merge commit
Git reset vs git revert: Revert is more precise, u could check and submit what modifies u want dismiss. Reset is more destructive, it does cancel a entire submission.
Git merge vs git rebase : I think merge is constructive, it does contain some method so you can solve the conflicts(if there is), rebase is destrutive, if something wrong already happen and the problem is complex, then we use rebase to solve it, rebase is disruptive so we hardly used at all.
Git pull vs git fetch: Both fetch changes from remote repo but "pull" will merges them into branch, and "fetch " does not.
